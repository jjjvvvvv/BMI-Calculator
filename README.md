# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## The Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to look at how to customise Flutter Widgets to achieve beautiful user interface designs.

I'm going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the designs of [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a two screen app with simple functionality and custom styling.
